  <h2> Pasta </h2>
  <img src="assets/images/pasta.jpg" width="350" class="center">
  <p> We are used to eating the traditional white wheat flour which is obtained from a grain produced at industrial levels and modified over the years to increase the amount produced. This type of production results in a flour with poor nutritional values. For this reason we cultivate ancient grains which in Italy the best known is the Senatore Cappelli wheat.
  The product made from this type of grain have particularly tasty flavour and odour.
  They are machined by grinding stone, the flour that is produced is therefore much less refined than that produced by modern wheat, thus keeping much more nutritional properties in the grain.
  The reduced presence of gluten in these grains, makes products derived from it, much lighter and easier to digest.
  Consuming the ancient grain also helps small producers who cultivate their land with love and respect for the environment, protecting the biodiversity for future generations.</p>
  We sell a variety of pasta, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Durum Wheat Paccheri</li>
        <li>Durum Wheat Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Rigatoni</li>
